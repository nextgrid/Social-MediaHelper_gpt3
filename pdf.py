AI is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals. AI applications can include things like advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, understanding human speech, self-driving cars, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems. As machines become more and more capable, the definition of AI continues to evolve. So far, AI has had a huge impact on our world and is only expected to keep growing. What do you think about the role of AI in our lives?'
